# Network Analysis

Assignment for the course Networks and Dynamical Systems of the interfaculty graduate program "Networks and Complexity".

The aim of the project was the analysis of a chosen network in order to gain familiarity with several metrics essential to network analysis.
In this repository, we analyze the terrorist network that participated in the Bali bombings in 2002. The jupyter notebook that 
contains the analysis is provided along with the data as an edgelist in xlsx format.

The xlsx dataset for the investigation of the network was based on the relational matrix of the following paper:

and Terrorism, 29:6, 559-575 DOI: 10.1080/10576100600798418.
