# Network Analysis

Assignments for the courses provided by the Master's Program "Network and Complexity".

The aim of the "Bali Bombing 10-2022 Analysis" project was intended for gaining familiarity with several metrics essential to network analysis.
The second jupyter notebook called "Terrorist Networks - Entropy Analysis" investigates the same network from the perspective of information theory.
Entropy measures are deployed to investigate the structure of the network and several metrics are tested to assess which ones are more effective for
a complete network dismantlement. 

The xlsx dataset for the investigation of the network was based on the relational matrix of the following paper:

Koschade, S., A Social Network Analysis of Jemmah-Islamiyah: The
Applications to Counterterorrism and Intelligence, Studies in Conflict
and Terrorism, 29:6, 559-575 DOI: 10.1080/10576100600798418.
